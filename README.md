# Condres Settings Manager

The Condres Settings Manager offers you a series of settings, which are
either enabled by Condres (i.e. installation of multiple kernels) or are 
missing from at least some of popular Desktop Environments and Window Managers.

Currently has modules written for Condres Hardware Detection (MHWD), Language,
Kernel, Keyboard, Time and Date and User Accounts.

It also includes a daemon to notify user of new language packages or kernels.

Condres Settings Manager is under active development.
